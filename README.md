# imgopt

Super simple script I use for editing images with sharp. Currently it's not at all meant to be efficient or well-written or anything - I literally just change the methods and input names/file extensions as I need to. Maybe someday I'll make this into a cli tool or desktop app, but right now I like this better than using random websites.
